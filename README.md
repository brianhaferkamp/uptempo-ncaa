# Uptempo Basketball - NCAA

This is the prototype for NCAA version of Uptempo Basketball. Download the cards and play according to the basic Uptempo rules. The main difference is that there is no defense in the game. Feel free to suggest a way to get a defense value, just be sure that is based on a reproduceable formula (i.e., based on stats or data that can be easily gotten and not based on subjective ratings). 

There are three demo teams to download (1 page): 1990 UNLV, 1990 Loyola Marymount, and 1992 Duke. Give these a try and see how the game plays.

## Timing

Game time in college is different than the NBA so the clock reflects two 20 minutes halves plus an overtime period. You will move the clock on each possession just as you do in the NBA version.

## Feedback

Please give your feedback on the college version. Are the games about right? Does scoring need to be throttled back or pumped up? Is game time (# of possessions) long enough? Please send your feedback to clarkandaddisongaming@gmail.com.
